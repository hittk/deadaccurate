# DeadAccurate

A native Android timegrapher: point a piezo contact microphone at a mechanical
watch and see, in real time, how accurately its escapement is beating.

Built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose on top of a low-latency AAudio capture
engine, with a software noise gate to isolate the escapement's acoustic
signature from background noise.

## Status

**M3 — beat-rate auto-detection and rate readout (code-complete).** The
whole v1 measurement chain now runs end to end: band-pass → envelope →
auto-calibrating noise gate → tick detection → beat-rate identification
(auto-lock with hysteresis across the six standard rates, manual override)
→ robust rate regression with unwrapped phase tracking and MAD outlier
rejection. The UI shows the headline ±s/day readout (greyed until the
estimation window is trustworthy), the locked/pinned/searching status, an
Auto + override rate selector, and dims rejected outlier dots on the tape.

The M3 acceptance bar is enforced by golden tests: from raw synthetic
audio, all six standard rates auto-lock and a 20 ppm rate error reads
within ±0.3 s/day. Pending hardware verification: cross-check against a
commercial timegrapher (limited by the device audio clock — see
docs/03-signal-processing.md §7). M4 (persistence and polish) is next.

### Building

```sh
./gradlew assembleDebug          # Android app (needs SDK + NDK)
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest      # JVM unit tests
./gradlew detekt                 # Kotlin static analysis

# Host C++ core tests (no Android SDK needed):
cmake -S engine/host -B engine/host/build
cmake --build engine/host/build
ctest --test-dir engine/host/build --output-on-failure
```

## Decisions already made

These were settled during planning and are treated as fixed unless revisited
deliberately:

- **v1 metrics:** real-time beat trace and rate deviation (s/day). Beat error
  and amplitude are stretch goals, but the pipeline is designed so they slot in.
- **Beat rate:** auto-detected from the signal against the standard set
  (18000–36000 bph), with a manual override in the UI.
- **Audio input:** external piezo contact mic on the 3.5mm TRRS headset path
  (directly or via USB-C dongle) is the primary input; the built-in microphone
  is a supported fallback.
- **Noise gate:** auto-calibrates its threshold from ambient noise at session
  start; the user can trim sensitivity with a slider.
- **Platform floor:** minSdk 31 (Android 12), AAudio via the NDK with the
  UNPROCESSED input preset, Kotlin + Jetpack Compose, single-activity app.
